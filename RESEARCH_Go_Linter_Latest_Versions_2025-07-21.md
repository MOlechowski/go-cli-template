## üéØ Recommendations

### **Primary Recommendation**
**golangci-lint v2.2.2 with optimized configuration** for comprehensive coverage while managing performance trade-offs.

**Recommended Configuration:**
```yaml
version: "2"

run:
  timeout: 15m
  concurrency: 4  # Memory management
  tests: true

linters:
  disable-all: true
  enable:
    - errcheck      # Critical error handling
    - gosec         # Security vulnerabilities
    - govet         # Built-in Go analysis
    - staticcheck   # Advanced static analysis (if memory allows)
    - gosimple      # Code simplification
    - ineffassign   # Performance optimization
    - unused        # Dead code detection
    - misspell      # Documentation quality
    - bodyclose     # Resource leak prevention
    - revive        # Style and best practices

linters-settings:
  revive:
    rules:
      - name: exported
        disabled: true  # Reduce noise for internal APIs

issues:
  exclude-dirs:
    - vendor
    - testdata
  new-from-rev: HEAD~1  # Focus on new changes
```

### **Alternative Approaches**

**For Resource-Constrained Environments:**
Use **revive + staticcheck separately** to avoid golangci-lint memory overhead while maintaining quality coverage.
